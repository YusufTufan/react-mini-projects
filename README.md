\# React Learning Journey



> A collection of foundational projects built while learning and mastering React. Each project focuses on a different core concept, building upon the last.



This repository serves as a log of my progress and hands-on practice with the React library. The projects are structured to isolate and demonstrate specific features and patterns in modern web development.

\## How to Run a Project



Each project is a standalone React application. To run any of the projects locally, follow these steps:



1\.  \*\*Clone the repository:\*\*

&nbsp;   ```sh

&nbsp;   git clone \[https://github.com/](https://github.com/)\[KullaniciAdin]/react-practice-hub.git

&nbsp;   ```



2\.  \*\*Navigate to the project directory:\*\*

&nbsp;   ```sh

&nbsp;   cd react-practice-hub/\[project-folder-name]

&nbsp;   # Example: cd react-practice-hub/01-creating-with-jsx

&nbsp;   ```



3\.  \*\*Install dependencies:\*\*

&nbsp;   ```sh

&nbsp;   npm install

&nbsp;   ```



4\.  \*\*Start the development server:\*\*

&nbsp;   ```sh

&nbsp;   npm start

&nbsp;   ```



This will run the app in development mode. Open \[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
